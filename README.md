### A web app assignment for Full-Stack Open React and Web Development Course

This is a simple React.js and Node.js-based web app to practice some concepts for each.

At the moment, this is a simple Backend and Frontend based list of fictional people and fictional phonenumbers.  This is subject to change as I make further progress into the course.
